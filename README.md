This is my personal CV
----------------------

This is just a personal online CV I attempted to create using Node.js, Express, Twitter's Bootstrap and Markdown language.  

You are free to clone it to learn from my mess and adapt to your own private or commercial projects __as long as you share alike__.  Some sort of links back to my Github would be very much appreciated, but not required.
